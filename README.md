This project was built using JavaScript and chart.js. It shows Kickstarter data from the past 9 years in terms of project goal money. The data is grouped by category, year, and whether a project was successful or not. A successful project is one that met its goal amount. Viewers can add as many categories as they are interested in, and change the year to see how goal money has changed over time by category. Hover over the bars to see the number of projects.
